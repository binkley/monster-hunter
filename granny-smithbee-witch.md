### Summary

A Forest Gnome witch who walks the narrow line between blessing and blight,
and guards her village and inhabitants as personal property.
She knows the old ways — **how to curse, how to heal**, and how to **stay
alive** when monsters howl through the wood.
Villagers bring her bread and salt when they need help.
Nobles bring her torches when they forget.
She is nosey, both respected and feared, and may bestow weal or woe.

This witch blends **Druid**, **Warlock**, and **Cleric-flavored** magic
through multiclassing and the *Acolyte* background.
Inspired by folk traditions and literary witches (especially Pratchett’s
headologists), she carries a walking staff, a tall hat, and several hatpins.

### Familiar — Old Mean Tomcat

The cat has one black eye and one yellow eye, but you're never sure which is
which. He is tattered, scruffy, and scarred, but popular with the lady cats.

- Grumbles at everyone except the witch.
- Mewls when things are going wrong, or senses looming troubles.
- Disappears for a day or two only to reappear covered in dust and blood that
  isn’t his.
- Will sit on spell scrolls unless properly bribed.
- Enjoys fish, spite, and naps in the center of summoning circles.

### Gear Highlights

- **Hat of the Sanguine Coven** — lets her cast *Chill Touch* at will; boosts
  death saves with creepy flair.
- **Quarterstaff of Warning** — senses danger while she sleeps.
- **Cloak of Spines** — brambles that fight back and boost AC.
- **Component Pouch** — everything a witch needs for casting.
- **Red Button (Holy Symbol)** — tiny, sewn into the inside of her sleeve.
- **Hatpin (customized shortsword)** — stuck in her hat, a weapon with a bite
  in a pinch.
- **Broom of Flying** — requires fetching and attunement swapping.

### Themes & Playstyle

- **Illusion & Influence**: Deceive and mislead without drawing a blade.
- **Curses & Counterspells**: Use *Hex*, *Bless*, and thematic spells to twist
  fate.
- **Folk Magic & Lore**: Speak to animals, sway villagers, and scare off
  bandits with reputation alone.
- **Headology**: “Magic with manners.” Hex their cow or bless their baby —
  both work.
- **Village Sentinel**: *Counterspell*, *Bless*, and *Guidance* make her a
  protector.

### Spellcasting Notes

- *Bless* is "a black ribbon tied around a babe’s crib."
- *False Life* comes as "a brew of mud, moss, and whisper."
- *Disguise Self* is "the face they expect."
- *Hypnotic Pattern* evokes "dancing candlelight and old lullabies."
