## NPC: The Appraiser (Name TBD)

*"If it hums, glows, or whispers, I catalog it. If it tries to bite, you pay
extra."*

---

### Description

The proprietor is quiet, meticulous, cautious — and seemingly omnipresent.
When he speaks, it’s in a cool, measured voice, with hints of amusement and
excitement kept under control.

His reputation is impeccable, though few nobles would admit to visiting his
shop without a disguise.
Adventurers, bounty hunters, monster slayers, and the occasional masked envoy
come seeking appraisals, discreet purchases, or help identifying dangerous
finds.

He frequently checks a large cabinet of handwritten catalog cards, apparently
one for each item.
When handling your finds, he wears gloves and takes meticulous notes.

### The Shop

Tucked behind a row of other pawnshops in the Dock Ward, the shop is easy to
miss without specific instructions.
There’s no signage — just a thick green curtain over a warped glass door.

Inside, the lighting is dim, the air dusty, and rows of locked cases line the
walls.
Tables clutter the center, making it hard to move without accidentally
bumping something — prompting the proprietor to ask, “Are you interested in
that?”

The shop is stuffed with odd and quirky items.
Some may be perfectly legal.
Others might be frowned upon by the local Watch, depending on the light and
your explanation.

  and cursed goods alike.

- Can act as an information node and quest hook for Kolchak and Bob.
