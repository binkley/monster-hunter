## The Witch

*"One foot in the church, the other in the fen. That’s how she stands."*

---

### Summary

A Forest Gnome Witch who walks the narrow line between blessing and blight.
She knows the old ways — **how to curse, how to heal**, and how to **stay
alive** when monsters howl through the wood. Villagers bring her bread and
salt when they need help. Nobles bring her torches when they forget.

This Witch blends **Druid**, **Warlock**, and **Cleric-flavored** magic
through clever multiclassing and the *Acolyte* background. Inspired by folk
traditions and literary witches (especially Pratchett’s headologists), she
carries no staff — only her shadow, her smile, and spells no one taught her.

### Notes

- Her version of *Bless* is "the black ribbon tied around a babe’s crib."
- Her *False Life* is a "brew of mud, moss, and whisper."
- Her *Disguise Self* is just putting on "the face they expect."
