### Summary

A Forest Gnome Witch who walks the narrow line between blessing and blight.
She knows the old ways — **how to curse, how to heal**, and how to **stay
alive** when monsters howl through the wood. Villagers bring her bread and
salt when they need help. Nobles bring her torches when they forget.

This Witch blends **Druid**, **Warlock**, and **Cleric-flavored** magic
through clever multiclassing and the *Acolyte* background. Inspired by folk
traditions and literary witches (especially Pratchett’s headologists), she
carries no staff — only her shadow, her smile, and spells no one taught her.

### Familiar &mdash; Old Mean Tomcat

The cat has one black eye and one yellow eye, but you're never sure which is
which.
He is tattered, scruffy, and scarred, but popular with the lady cats.

- Grumbles at everyone except the witch.
- Mewls when things are going wrong, or senses looming troubles.
- Disappears for a day or two only to reappear covered in dust and blood that
  isn’t his.
- Will sit on spell scrolls unless properly bribed.
- Enjoys fish, spite, and naps in the center of summoning circles.

### Themes & Playstyle

- **Illusion & Influence**: Deceive and mislead without drawing a blade.
- **Curses & Counterspells**: Use *Hex*, *Bless*, and thematic spells to twist
  fate.
- **Folk Magic & Lore**: Speak to animals, sway villagers, and scare off
  bandits with reputation alone.
- **Nosey**: Your business is her business, and she's not reluctant to speak
  her mind.
- **Don't Believe Your Eyes**: Shape-changing and use *Disguise Self*.
  She might entertain village children &mdash; or hex the toys of the naughty.

### Notes

- Her version of *Bless* is "the black ribbon tied around a babe’s crib."
- Her *False Life* is a "brew of mud, moss, and whisper."
- Her *Disguise Self* is just putting on "the face they expect."
