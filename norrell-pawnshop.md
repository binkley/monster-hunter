# NPC: Norrell — The Appraiser

*"If it hums, glows, or whispers, I catalog it. If it tries to bite, you pay
extra."*

---

## Description

The proprietor is quiet, meticulous, cautious — and seemingly omnipresent.
He speaks in a cool, measured voice, his amusement and excitement carefully
masked.

His reputation is impeccable, though few nobles would admit to visiting his
shop without a disguise.
Adventurers, bounty hunters, monster slayers, and the occasional masked envoy
come seeking appraisals, discreet purchases, or help identifying dangerous
finds.

He frequently checks a large cabinet of handwritten catalog cards, apparently
one for each item.
When handling your finds, he wears gloves and takes meticulous notes.

## The Shop

Tucked behind a row of other pawnshops in the Dock Ward, the shop is easy to
miss without specific instructions.
There’s no signage — just a thick green curtain over a warped glass door.

Inside, the lighting is dim, the air dusty, and rows of locked cases line the
walls.
Tables clutter the center, making it hard to move without accidentally
bumping something — prompting the proprietor to ask, “Are you interested in
that?”

The shop is stuffed with odd and quirky items.
Some may be perfectly legal.
Others might be frowned upon by the local Watch, depending on the light and
your explanation.

### Traits

**Careful Examination.**
When The Appraiser takes 10 minutes to examine an item using appropriate tools,
he can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana, Investigation, or History) check
to determine a magical property, cultural origin, or forged feature.
On a success, he uncovers a key detail.
On a failure, he may consult a contact and provide an answer within 1d4 days.

**Meticulous Records.** The Appraiser can consult his records for a specific
item or transaction from years past, including its properties or possible
present market value, but will be reluctant unless incentivized.

**Pawnbroker’s Caution.**
The Appraiser never triggers cursed or attuned effects when handling a magic
item, thanks to his extensive cataloging and gloves.
This functions as advantage on saving throws against item-based magical effects.

**Ritual Casting.**
He can cast the following spells, requiring no components, but only as rituals,
and prefers *not* to unless compensated or ingruiged:
- *Comprehend Languages*
- *Detect Magic*
- *Identify*

___

### Actions

+**Silvered Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft.
or range 20/60 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.
Usually tucked in a sleeve, just in case.
 
**Dust of Truth (Recharge 5–6).** The Appraiser can toss a pinch of silvery
powder over an item or speaker once per day, briefly revealing lies or false
magic.
The affected creature or object must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw
or be affected by *Zone of Truth* or *Detect Magic* for 1 minute (Appraiser’s
choice).

___
