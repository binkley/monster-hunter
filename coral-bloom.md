### Personality

**Personality Traits**

* I speak in metaphors drawn from sea creatures, currents, and tides.
* I believe kindness spreads faster than storms.

**Ideals**

* The ocean gives life, not just takes it. We should heal as much as we defend.
* Magic should shimmer with the beauty of the reef.

**Bonds**

* I protect a sacred coral grove that births rare sea life once every
  tide-turning moon.
* I carry a tide-blessed shard of reefstone passed down through many bloom
  cycles.

**Flaws**

* I cannot abide decay or defilement of coral. Pollution enrages me beyond
  sense.
* I often underestimate danger, trusting the sea will shelter me.

### Notes

* Contrast to *Green Shillelagh*: she is warm seas to Shillelagh's cold tide
* Could be an ally, a student, or a distant cousin from another sea
* Designed to evoke reef beauty, lunar tides, and life-filled water
* Less a warrior-priestess, more a song of coral brought to bloom
