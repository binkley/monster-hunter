---

## Act I — *Footprints in the Fog*

Kolchak is hired to quietly investigate the disappearance of a hedge mage
named *Ilin Tharn*, who failed to return to the city after a week away. The
job’s supposed to be simple: go to his room, check his notes, follow the trail
if one exists. It never is.

### Opening Hook

> The job offer is scrawled on the back of a discarded playbill and shoved
> under your door. It’s not signed, but it smells of pipe ash and old ink.
> "Discreet help needed. Ilin’s missing. Room paid till Sundown. Don’t touch
> the crows. —B."

### Scene 1: The Room Upstairs

*The Quill & Candle*, a cheap but clean inn. Ilin’s room is locked.

**Entry Options:**
- **Thieves’ Tools DC 11** to unlock the door quietly.
- **Deception or Bribe (DC 10)** to get the clerk to open it.

**Clues Found:**

| Item | Description | Skill/Insight |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Obsidian dust | A faint ring on the floor under the bed | *Arcana DC 12* (summoning residue) |
| Crude glyph | Smeared chalk glyph on wardrobe interior | *Religion or Arcana DC 13* (fey ward) |
| Half-burned note | "Meet at dusk, beneath the tree that bleeds. Do not come in steel." | No check |
| Satchel with sketch | Page torn from a guide, crude drawing of a faceless creature | *History DC 14* (doppelganger) |

**If Kolchak has _Field Notes, Collected_**: the book flips open on its own to a mostly torn-out page. Only one line remains:  

> "They are not who they were. Don’t look too long."

### Scene 2: Lusk the Fence

Lusk operates behind *Glasya’s Drapery*. Entry requires:
- Special knock (*Thieves' Cant*), or
- *Persuasion DC 12* or *Deception DC 10*

> "Well, well," Lusk drawls, grinning like a weasel in a henhouse. "Kolchak,
> my favorite unpaid informant. What brings you slithering in today — or did
> something try to wear your face?"

**What Lusk Knows:**
- Ilin was buying info on *mirror magic*, *fey-touched places*, and *names not
  meant to be spoken*.
- "A priest came poking around, looking for Ilin too. Big jaw, big mace, big
  faith. South Orchard if you want him."

**Lusk's Spellcasting:**
- Will cast *Identify* as a ritual, **if paid 5 gp** or bartered with
  something weird.
- Offers cryptic wisdom:  
> "If it came from the tree line, don’t follow it unless it runs. Then don’t
> stop."

### Optional Interlude: The First Shadow

If Kolchak stays overnight before heading to the woods:
- **Perception DC 15** notices a figure outside, unmoving, watching.
- **Investigation DC 12** finds a page missing from Ilin’s notes — not torn,
  but vanished.
- If he speaks aloud to the book, it replies:  
> *It remembers you.*

### End of Act I

Kolchak heads south, following the note to the *tree that bleeds*.  
Night gathers. The fog follows.

### Act II — *The Grove, the Body, the Book*

Kolchak reaches the ritual site: a mossy clearing around a weeping tree. The
hedge mage lies dead, spine broken in an unnatural way, hands clutching an
empty wine bottle and a charred book.

**Encounter**: A minor corrupted fey or *darkling swarm* appears — shadowed
figures driven to destroy written knowledge. Kolchak is overwhelmed.

**Entrance of Bob Jones**: A traveling divine spellcaster (ostensibly on his
own errand) arrives mid-fight. Between the two of them, the creatures are
defeated or driven off.

**Discovery**:
- The book is clearly magical but unreadable.
- The wine bottle smells of lavender and rot.
- The area pulses with lingering illusion magic.
- The mage's ring bears a familiar insignia — a detail Kolchak may recognize
  from his earlier investigation.

---

### Act III — *The Book Opens Its Eye*

Kolchak and Bob return to the city together. Bob is curious about the book and
disturbed by what happened — they agree to speak with someone discreet.

*decode*Scene: Lusk the Smiler again** — for a price (or favor), he casts
**Identify** on the book.

- **Result**: It is an *Enduring Spellbook*, and something else… the magic is
  old, compiled, collective. The title appears as *Field Notes, Collected*
  only after the spell is complete.
- Only the attuned can read it fully — and the book *wants* to be read.

**Final Beat**:
- Kolchak opens to the first page and sees the introduction.
- Bob mutters a prayer and says, "If that thing followed us out of the woods,
  we may need more than that book."
- Kolchak looks up, and a nearby candle flame flickers... even though no wind
  stirs.
