### Act I — *Footprints in the Fog*

Kolchak is hired to quietly investigate the disappearance of a hedge mage who
failed to return to the city. The job's supposed to be simple: go to his cabin
near the edge of a fey-touched wood, retrieve any notes, and leave.

**Scene Elements**:
- **Urban exploration**: Kolchak breaks into the hedge mage's room — finds
  fragments of obsidian dust, a crude glyph, and notes mentioning "things
wearing human faces" and a rendezvous "at dusk beneath the tree that bleeds."
- **Bar or fence scene**: He checks in with a known contact, *Lusk the
  Smiler*, a fence who warns that "odd folk" paid for divination recently —
and a priest (Bob) was asking questions.

This act ends as Kolchak slips outside the city toward the grove.

### Act II — *The Grove, the Body, the Book*

Kolchak reaches the ritual site: a mossy clearing around a weeping tree. The
hedge mage lies dead, spine broken in an unnatural way, hands clutching an
empty wine bottle and a charred book.

**Encounter**: A minor corrupted fey or *darkling swarm* appears — shadowed
figures driven to destroy written knowledge. Kolchak is overwhelmed.

**Entrance of Bob Jones**: A traveling divine spellcaster (ostensibly on his
own errand) arrives mid-fight. Between the two of them, the creatures are
defeated or driven off.

**Discovery**:
- The book is clearly magical but unreadable.
- The wine bottle smells of lavender and rot.
- The area pulses with lingering illusion magic.
- The mage's ring bears a familiar insignia — a detail Kolchak may recognize
  from his earlier investigation.

### Act III — *The Book Opens Its Eye*

Kolchak and Bob return to the city together. Bob is curious about the book and
disturbed by what happened — they agree to speak with someone discreet.

*decode*Scene: Lusk the Smiler again** — for a price (or favor), he casts **Identify** on the book.

- **Result**: It is an *Enduring Spellbook*, and something else… the magic is
  old, compiled, collective. The title appears as *Field Notes, Collected*
  only after the spell is complete.
- Only the attuned can read it fully — and the book *wants* to be read.

**Final Beat**:
- Kolchak opens to the first page and sees the introduction.
- Bob mutters a prayer and says, "If that thing followed us out of the woods,
  we may need more than that book."
- Kolchak looks up, and a nearby candle flame flickers... even though no wind
  stirs.
