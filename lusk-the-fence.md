### Traits

_**Arcane Dabbler.**_ Lusk can cast the *Identify* spell as a ritual. He also
knows the *Mage Hand* and *Prestidigitation* cantrips. He cannot cast leveled
spells unless using scrolls or items.

_**Grease-Stained Ledger.**_ Lusk may have access to obscure names, magical
rumors, and arcane artifacts—for a price. Once per day, he can provide a
useful (but possibly cryptic) hint about a magic item or creature when bribed
properly.

_**Nobody Stabs the Fence.**_ Once per short rest, when Lusk would take damage,
he can use his reaction to shout "I’m just the middleman!" and impose
disadvantage on the attack roll or saving throw.

___
### Actions

_**Dagger.**_ *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +1 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.


_**Spell Use (Identify).**_ Lusk can cast *Identify* as a ritual, provided he
has 10 minutes, a pearl worth 100 gp (which he insists *you* provide), and a
smug expression.

___
### Roleplaying Lusk

- Always grinning, but never friendly.
- Smells faintly of unfamiliar herbs.
- His stall is hidden behind a tapestry shop, behind an unlocked door, behind
  a broom closet.
- Will absolutely overcharge, but is truthful. Information is accurate, just
  hard to understand.
- Refers to others with private nicknames, almost but not quite insulting, and
  often obscure.
