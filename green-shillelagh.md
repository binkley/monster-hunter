### Notes

- Keeps a written account of her party’s victories as a ritual obligation  
- Her Sage background is flavored as an oral historian and storm-poet  
- Stoic and poetic, she worships Gruumsh as a witness, not as a slayer  
- She respects water but **fears the abyssal deep**—she avoids looking into it  

---

### DM Notes

- Character contrasts well with more “civilized” druids; emphasizes memory,
  rage, control  
- Orcish culture is reflected through honor, wrath, and ritual—not savagery  
- Excellent candidate for cold/ice/ocean survival campaigns  
- Party chronicler with flavor-rich voice and thematic cohesion
