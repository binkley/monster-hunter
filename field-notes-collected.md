# Field Notes, Collected

(See [this
item](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/10084424-field-notes-collected) on
D&D Beyond homebrew.)

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This book is an **Enduring Spellbook**; anything written on its pages can’t be
damaged by fire or immersion in water, and resists the effects of age and
decay.

The heavy Wyvern-hide leather cover is embedded with a large, orange cat's-eye
gemstone. You feel the eye follows you but are never certain. The book seems
altered and restitched several times; the pages vary in material and quality.
It takes two hands to hold the book open. Casting *Identify* shows this is a
Wizard's personal spellbook, but until attuned the pages remain blank and
writing in the book leaves the pages blank.

After attuning you recognize it is a well-used spellbook and guide for hunting
monsters. When you leaf through the pages, you see a mixture of spells,
monster descriptions, advice, and comments. The book and pages are tattered,
stained, scorched, drowned, and pocked with bite marks, but remain intact. The
binding shows that some pages were torn out or destroyed, and additional pages
have been stitched in. No author is identified, and the writing shows many
hands.

The first pages written in a precise hand legible to you in your native
language if attuned, and describe the book as an anthology of transcriptions
along with notes. Remaining pages are a mix of stronger spells, descriptions
of monsters, and confusing advice or comments.

The book is too heavy to easily hold in one hand. To use this book as a spell
focus requires both hands.

## Attunement Effects

- The book may be used as a wizard’s spellbook.
- Once attuned, you always open to the page you're thinking of.
- Other attuned readers may experience a different page order, content, or
  even commentary.
