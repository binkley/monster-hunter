# NPC: Bardolf Caine — The Deuteroscopist

*"The living lie. The dead reveal truths."*

---

## Role

- **Forensic Examiner of Men and Monsters.**
  Specializes in identifying bodies, monster remains, magical wounds, curses
  on corpses, and unnatural deaths.
- **Second Sight (Figurative).**
  Possesses not supernatural clairvoyance, but trained perception and
  intuition.
- **Trusted Advisor.**
  Warns of dangers from bodies presented to him, and asks questions overlooked
  that the remains reveal.

---

## Flavor Notes

- **Tone**: Calm, clinical, detached — but sometimes grimly witty.
- **Speech**: Precise language, no wasted words, uses anatomical and magical
  terminology fluidly.
- **Habits**:
  - Wears spectacles of different colored lenses each time you meet him.
    Are these for his profession?
  - Strangely addresses corpses with professional courtesy ("Sir" or "Madam"
    or "Doctor" or "Lord").
  - Keeps notes in a leather-bound *Ledger of Quiet Testimonies*.

### Sample interactions

> "The living are dishonest even in their dying.
> But the flesh itself — it has no tongue left to lie with when tongue it still
> has."

> You notice a faint tremor pass through the Deuteroscopist's hand as he
> lifts the tattered flesh.
> His voice is distant when he mutters: "It still dreams of running... even
> now."

> He chuckles when seeing the corpse you brought him with its throat torn out.
> "I guess this one won't be eating soup again.
> More's the pity, that."

> On a successful postmortem, he might say,
> "The lungs... yes. They still whisper the name of what broke them."

> At twilight, Bardolf sometimes lingers outside his stone-walled workplace,
> leaning against the lintel, staring across toward the City of the Dead.
>
> "The wind runs backward there some nights," he murmurs.
> "Whispers and smells and memories — not all of them yours.
> Much I glean from those remains, but I fear them."
>
> He snuffs out his lantern early those nights, double-bars the door, and
> refuses visitors until dawn.

## Workplace

- Operates out of an unassuming, quiet stone building in the Castle Ward off
  Selduth Street and High Street, near the City of the Dead district.
- Next door is a popular butcher's shop.
- The air smells faintly of cedarwood to mask stronger odors.
- Furnished with:
  - Stone slabs for examination.
  - An interior icehouse where corpses and remains are kept.
  - Iron-bound cabinets of surgical tools, scrolls, specimen jars.
  - Large bookshelves packed with tomes on anatomy, history, field reports,
    and most with languages you do not recognize.
  - A preserved chimera heart framed on the wall ("Even monsters have
    rules.").

### Traits

**Careful Postmortem.**
When the Deuteroscopist spends at least 10 minutes examining a corpse or
remains, they can automatically determine if death was natural, magical,
cursed, or monstrous.
They automatically recognize common beasts, humanoids, and undead.
For rarer or unnatural creatures, the Deuteroscopist can attempt a DC 10 +
creature CR check using Arcana, History, Investigation, or Medicine (DM's
choice).
On a success, they identify the creature type and species, and provide useful
details such as known weaknesses, behaviors, or known variants.
On a failure, they still glean vague or unsettling insights — *distorted
memories*, *phantom pains*, or *impossible echoes* hint at the body's nature.

**Residual Magic Reading.**
Once per long rest, the Deuteroscopist can cast *Detect Magic* or *Identify*
as a ritual without material components, but only when examining a corpse or
remains.
Sometimes, this awakens latent magic that was better left undisturbed.

**Uncanny Instinct.**
The Deuteroscopist has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or
charmed, gained from long exposure to supernatural horrors.
Upon encountering an unfamiliar monstrosity, they often mutter *odd warnings*
before danger becomes clear.
